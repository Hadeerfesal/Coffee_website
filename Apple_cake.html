    <p>Apple cake is a popular dessert produced with the main ingredient of apples. Such a cake is made through the
        process of slicing this sweet fruit to add fragrance to a plain cake base. Traditional apple cakes go a step
        further by including
        various spices such as nutmeg or cinnamon, which give a unique flavour. Upon the addition of spices the batter
        can also be accompanied by crushed nuts, the most popular being walnuts and almonds.</p>
