    <p>Avocado cake is a cake prepared using avocado as a primary ingredient, together with other typical cake
        ingredients. The avocados can be mashed, and may be used as an ingredient in cake batter, in cake toppings and
        alone atop a
        cake. Cake variations include raw avocado cake, avocado brownies and avocado cheesecake. Raw, uncooked versions
        of avocado cake can be high in vitamin E and essential fatty acids, which are derived from avocado.
        Avocado-based
        cake toppings include avocado fool and avocado crazy</p>
